- Security assessment and testing
- Security operations
- Software development security

**Resources:**
- CISSP official materials
- Security frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)
- Leadership and management training

**Critical:** CISSP requires 5 years of paid work experience in 2 or more CISSP domains.

### Phase 4: Cloud Architecture (Optional, 7+ years experience)
**Target:** CCSP

Specialize in cloud security architecture:
- Cloud concepts, architecture, and design
- Cloud data security
- Cloud platform and infrastructure security
