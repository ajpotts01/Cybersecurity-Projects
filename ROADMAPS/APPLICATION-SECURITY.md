# Application Security Certification Roadmap

A structured path to becoming an Application Security professional, specializing in securing the software development lifecycle and finding vulnerabilities in applications.

## Career Path Overview

Application Security professionals work with development teams to build secure software. This role requires understanding both security and software development, including secure coding practices, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and integrating security into DevOps pipelines (DevSecOps).

**Note:** OSWE is hands-on - you must find and exploit vulnerabilities in real applications during a 48-hour exam.

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Web Pentesting (Optional, 2+ years)
**Target:** GWAPT

Deepen web app testing expertise:
- Web application reconnaissance
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation testing
