# Cloud Security Engineer Certification Roadmap

A structured path to becoming a Cloud Security Engineer, specializing in securing cloud infrastructure, platforms, and applications.

## Career Path Overview

Cloud Security Engineers design, implement, and maintain security controls for cloud environments. With organizations rapidly moving to cloud platforms, this role is in high demand. Cloud security requires deep knowledge of both traditional security principles and cloud-specific architectures across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
