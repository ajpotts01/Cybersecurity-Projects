# Penetration Tester Certification Roadmap

A structured path to becoming a professional penetration tester, from foundations through advanced offensive security expertise.

## Career Path Overview

Penetration testers ethically hack systems to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. This roadmap progresses from basic security knowledge to advanced exploit development and penetration testing.

### Phase 2: Pentesting Basics (3-6 months)
**Target:** PenTest+

Learn core penetration testing:
- Reconnaissance and enumeration
- Vulnerability scanning
- Exploitation basics
- Post-exploitation techniques
- Reporting and documentation

**Resources:**
- CompTIA PenTest+ study materials
