# Incident Responder Certification Roadmap

A structured path to becoming an Incident Responder, specializing in investigating, containing, and remediating security breaches and cyber attacks.

## Career Path Overview

Incident Responders are the front-line defenders when security incidents occur. They investigate breaches, contain threats, perform forensic analysis, and coordinate recovery efforts. This role requires deep technical skills in forensics, malware analysis, and threat hunting.
