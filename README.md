# Project Ideas 👻

I'm thinking **2-3 sentences per project** - enough to get started, not overwhelming. Format like:

**Project Name**
Short description of what to build. Key tech/approach to use. One specific implementation tip or gotcha.

Let me write them out:

---

## 🔰 Beginner Projects

### Simple Port Scanner
Build a Python script using the `socket` library to test common ports (22, 80, 443, 3306, etc.) on a target IP. Implement threading or asyncio to scan multiple ports concurrently for speed. Add service detection by analyzing banner responses from open ports.

### Basic Keylogger
Use Python's `pynput` library to capture keyboard events and log them to a local file with timestamps. Include a toggle key (like F12) to start/stop logging. **Important**: Add clear disclaimers and only test on systems you own.

### Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder
Create a CLI tool that shifts characters by a specified number (the "key") to encrypt/decrypt text. Implement both encryption and brute-force decryption (try all 26 possible shifts). Bonus: Add support for preserving spaces and punctuation.

### DNS Lookup Tool
Use Python's `dnspython` library to query different DNS record types (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, NS, CNAME). Display results in a clean table format with color coding. Add reverse DNS lookup functionality.

### Simple Vulnerability Scanner
Build a script that checks installed software versions against a CVE database or uses `pip-audit` for Python packages. Parse system package managers (apt, yum, brew) to list installed software. Flag packages with known vulnerabilities and suggest updates.

---

## 🔶 Intermediate Projects

### Reverse Shell Handler
Create a server that listens for incoming reverse shell connections using Python sockets. Implement command execution, file upload/download, and session management for multiple clients. Use `cmd2` or similar library for a clean CLI interface.

### SIEM Dashboard
Build a Flask/FastAPI backend that ingests logs via syslog or file parsing, then visualize with a React frontend using Chart.js or Recharts. Store events in SQLite/PostgreSQL and implement basic correlation rules (e.g., "5 failed logins in 1 minute"). Add filtering by severity, source IP, and time range.

### Threat Intelligence Aggregator
Use APIs from threat feeds (AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX) to collect IOCs (IPs, domains, file hashes). Store in a database with deduplication and enrich with WHOIS/geolocation data. Create a simple UI to search IOCs and view threat scores.

### OAuth Token Analyzer
Build a tool that decodes JWT tokens, validates signatures, and checks for common vulnerabilities (weak secrets, algorithm confusion, expired claims). Use PyJWT or similar library and add support for multiple signature algorithms (HS256, RS256). Display token payload in formatted JSON with security warnings.

### Web Application Vulnerability Scanner
Create an async Python scanner using `httpx` that crawls a target website and tests for XSS (reflected/stored), SQLi (error-based), and CSRF (missing tokens). Implement a plugin architecture so tests are modular and easy to add. Generate HTML reports with vulnerability details and remediation advice.

### Encrypted Chat Application
Build a peer-to-peer chat using WebSockets with end-to-end encryption via the `cryptography` library (Fernet or RSA+AES). Implement key exchange using Diffie-Hellman. Add a simple React frontend with message history and user authentication.

### DDoS Mitigation Tool
Create a network monitor that detects traffic spikes using packet sniffing (Scapy) and implements rate limiting with iptables or similar. Add anomaly detection by establishing baseline traffic patterns. Include alerts via email/webhook when attacks detected.

### Container Security Scanner
Scan Docker images by parsing Dockerfiles for insecure practices (running as root, hardcoded secrets) and checking base image versions against vulnerability databases. Use Docker API to inspect running containers for exposed ports and mounted volumes. Output findings in JSON with severity ratings.

---

## 🔴 Advanced Projects

### Custom Exploit Development Framework
Build a modular framework in Python where exploits are plugins (one file per vulnerability). Include payload generators, shellcode encoders, and target validation. Implement a Metasploit-like interface with search, configure, and execute commands.

### AI-Powered Threat Detection System
Train a machine learning model (Random Forest or LSTM) on network traffic data (CICIDS2017 dataset) to classify normal vs. malicious behavior. Use feature engineering on packet metadata (packet size, timing, protocols). Deploy model with FastAPI for real-time inference on live traffic.

### Full-Stack Bug Bounty Platform
Create a web app with user roles (researchers, companies), vulnerability submission workflow, and reward management. Implement severity scoring (CVSS), status tracking, and encrypted communications. Use React frontend, FastAPI/Django backend, PostgreSQL database, and S3 for file uploads.

### Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)
Build a tool using boto3 (AWS), Azure SDK, and Google Cloud SDK to scan for misconfigurations (public S3 buckets, overly permissive IAM roles, unencrypted storage). Implement compliance checks against CIS benchmarks. Generate executive dashboards showing risk scores and remediation priorities.

### Malware Analysis Platform
Create a sandbox using Docker or VMs where suspicious files are executed in isolation while monitoring API calls, network traffic, and file system changes. Implement static analysis (strings, PE headers, YARA rules) and dynamic analysis (behavior tracking). Generate detailed reports with IOCs extracted.

### Quantum-Resistant Encryption Implementation
Implement post-quantum algorithms like Kyber (key exchange) or Dilithium (digital signatures) using existing libraries (liboqs-python). Build a file encryption tool that uses hybrid encryption (classical + quantum-resistant). Benchmark performance against traditional RSA/AES and document the security rationale.
