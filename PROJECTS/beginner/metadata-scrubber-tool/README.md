> Privacy-focused CLI that strips sensitive metadata from images, PDFs, and Office documents.

*This is a quick overview — security theory, architecture, and full walkthroughs are in the [learn modules](#learn).*

## What It Does

- Strip metadata from JPEG, PNG, PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files
- Concurrent processing with ThreadPoolExecutor handles 1000+ files efficiently
- Dry-run mode previews what would be removed before making changes
- Verification reports show before/after comparison of metadata fields
- Smart format detection uses file signatures, not extensions
- Removes GPS coordinates, author info, timestamps, camera data, and software traces

## Quick Start

```bash
uv tool install metadata-scrubber
mst scrub photo.jpg
```

> [!TIP]
> This project uses [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner. Type `just` to see all available commands.
>
> Install: `curl -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/.local/bin`
