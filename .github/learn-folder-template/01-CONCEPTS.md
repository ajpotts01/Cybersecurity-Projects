# Core Security Concepts

This document explains the security concepts you'll encounter while building this project. These are not just definitions - we'll dig into why they matter and how they actually work.

## [Primary Concept]

### What It Is

[Explain the concept in plain language. No jargon without explanation. Assume the reader is smart but unfamiliar.]

### Why It Matters

[Explain the real world impact. What goes wrong without it? Reference actual breaches or incidents if relevant.]

### How It Works

[Break down the technical mechanism. Use examples and code snippets where helpful. ASCII diagrams are good.]

```
[Diagram or code example showing the concept in action]
```

### Common Attacks

[List specific attack techniques that exploit this. Be concrete about what an attacker does.]

1. **[Attack 1]** - [How it works, what the attacker gains]
2. **[Attack 2]** - [How it works, what the attacker gains]
3. **[Attack 3]** - [How it works, what the attacker gains]

### Defense Strategies

[Explain how to protect against these attacks. Connect back to what this project implements.]

## [Secondary Concept]

### What It Is

[Same structure as above]

### Why It Matters

[Real world impact]

### How It Works

[Technical mechanism]

### Common Pitfalls

[Where developers get this wrong. Based on actual mistakes you see in production code.]

**Mistake 1: [Common error]**
```[language]
# Bad
[code showing the mistake]

# Good
[code showing the correct approach]
```

**Mistake 2: [Another common error]**
[Explanation of why this is wrong]

## [Additional Concept]

[Follow same pattern for each major concept]

## How These Concepts Relate

[Show how the concepts connect to each other. Security is a system, not isolated techniques.]

```
[Concept 1]
    ↓
  affects
    ↓
[Concept 2]
    ↓
  requires
    ↓
[Concept 3]
```

## Industry Standards and Frameworks

### OWASP Top 10

This project addresses:
- **[OWASP Category]** - [Specific vulnerability and how this project handles it]
- **[Another category]** - [How this project relates]

### MITRE ATT&CK

Relevant techniques:
- **[Technique ID]** - [Technique name] - [How this project detects or prevents it]
- **[Another technique]** - [Connection to the project]

### CWE

Common weakness enumerations covered:
- **[CWE-XXX]** - [Weakness name] - [How this project demonstrates or prevents it]

## Real World Examples

### Case Study 1: [Actual Incident]

[Describe a real breach or vulnerability that relates to these concepts. Include:
- What happened
- How the attack worked
- What defenses failed
- How this could have been prevented]

### Case Study 2: [Another Example]

[Another real world example]

## Testing Your Understanding

Before moving to the architecture, make sure you can answer:

1. [Question that tests understanding of concept 1]
2. [Question that requires applying concept 2]
3. [Question that connects multiple concepts]

If these questions feel unclear, re-read the relevant sections. The implementation will make more sense once these fundamentals click.

## Further Reading

**Essential:**
- [Resource 1] - [Why this is valuable]
- [Resource 2] - [What you'll get from it]

**Deep dives:**
- [Advanced resource 1] - [When to read this]
- [Advanced resource 2] - [What this covers that we didn't]

**Historical context:**
- [Paper or talk] - [Why this matters for understanding the evolution]
